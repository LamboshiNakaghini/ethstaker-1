## Can I get involved with EthStaker?

[This](staking-glossary.md) is a living documentation site, which means we need help from the community to maintain and [update](getting-started/what-is-ethereum-staking.md) the content. Any contribution, from writing whole sections, translations, to simply correcting spelling and grammar mistakes will be greatly appreciated.
