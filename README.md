# EthStaker Knowledge Base

#### Welcome to the EthStaker Knowledge base! This site is a public collection of useful information and concepts about Ethereum staking.

This is a living documentation site, which means we need help from the community to maintain and update the content. Any contribution, from writing whole sections, translations, to simply correcting spelling and grammar mistakes will be greatly appreciated.
